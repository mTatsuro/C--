* to compile: make 

* to run the lexer:
        ./lexer source_code_file
  example:
        ./lexer ../test_suite/test_arrays.c-- 

* if you add more .h files, put them in the includes subdirectory
* if you add more .c files, refer to the associated .o file in the
_OBJ def in the Makefile 
* definitely add more comments to this starting point code!
